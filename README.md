RRBSsim
RRBSsim: reduced representation bisulfite sequencing simulator for next-generation sequencing

1 Introduction
==============
RRBSsim can produce paired-end RRBS simulated reads, with a series of characters generated by 
 Illumina sequencing platform, such as insert size distribution, sequencing error(substitution, 
 insertion, deletion), quality score and GC content-coverage bias.
